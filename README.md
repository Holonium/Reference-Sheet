Reference-Sheet  
In order to make the submission process easier, and the integration faster, it makes my life easier if the specifications are written down in a standard form. Suggestions are still accepted in other forms, but are less likely to be implemented quickly. The format will be found in the "submission.txt" file in the root directory.  
All new entries should be added to the draft branch, which will then be reviewed before being merged with the master branch in order to improve the accuracy of the system.
